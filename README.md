## PROJECT OUTLINE
Welcome to the 'Hazards-Match Card-Game' from the Science Shuffle Team! 

This engaging card-match activity is inspired by a physical game created for Year 7 pupils learning laboratory safety by one of our team in their previous career. It was used as a recap at the end of a lesson on safe chemical handling, and it later became a regular classroom ‘starter’ activity to reinforce safety principles throughout Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14) as new chemicals and materials that display GHS hazard symbols were introduced to their learning.

The learning objective of the ‘Working Scientifically’ unit is for pupils to describe processes and key characteristics in common language, while also using technical terminology accurately. The game is designed to enable understanding of the hazards and risks associated with substances carrying these labels, to extend specialist vocabulary and ensure precise use of health and safety terminology. Knowledge of GHS hazard symbols extends beyond the classroom to wider society in the use of common household chemicals (such as detergents) and to those working with hazardous substances (such as Pharmaceuticals, Waste Management, Manufacturing, Hygienists, Emergency Responders and those training in Health & Safety certification (eg NEBOSSH/COSSH/DSEAR and REACH)), making it essential for everyone to recognize and understand these symbols. As such, this game is suitable for all ages, from Key Stage 3 pupils to adults.

In 2015, the GHS was updated to replace the various hazardous material classification systems previously used worldwide, including the old orange CHIP (Control of Hazardous Materials) symbols used in the UK, which many previous learning resources were derived from and continue to use. The Science Shuffle 'Hazards-Match' game uses the updated GHS symbols and meanings, ensuring it is relevant to today’s standards. The game offers multiple difficulty levels: Easy - matching hazard symbols with label names, Medium - matching hazard symbols with descriptions of risk, and Hard - matching label names with descriptions of risk without symbols. This ensures a challenging and educational experience for players of all ages.

As the primary target audience is Key Stage 3 Science students working within a classroom laboratory environment,  the primary design is therefore Tablet-first (using 1112px by 834px screen dimensions), as tablets are the go-to device used in school laboratories. Mobile is considered as secondary (for other learners) and desktop last. The readability of the both the Label Cards and Description cards are optimally viewed in Tablet or Laptop screen sizes*. 

The features such as the 'Timer' and 'Number of Moves' counters and the 'Restart' button etc all remain in the body of the window without the need for scrolling in any device screen sizes. This is to ensure that the user can see all relevant features in one viewport for the focus to remain on the content of the game rather than introduce distractions. 

The game is designed as a revision tool to consolidate learning after study of the Hazards have taken place, however, a modal is provided with an overview of the required information for those who are new to the concept so that it can be used as a study tool in the first instance if necessary.

## PROJECT PLANNING

### UX Design

To ensure our project was user-centric, we began by conducting thorough user research to gather insights and understand the target audience’s needs. This foundational step informed the creation of wireframes for the main page(s), where we meticulously defined the layout and user flow to provide a seamless experience. We then determined a cohesive thematic style that visually represented the game’s intended appearance, incorporating appropriate colours, typography, and design elements. Throughout the process, we collaborated closely to ensure the feasibility of our design concepts. This included providing essential design assets, such as fonts, images and icons, required for the web app’s implementation.

As we moved into the implementation phase, we focused on accurately translating the design into HTML and CSS. Usability testing was conducted across various devices to guarantee a consistent and intuitive user experience. We conducted comprehensive usability testing sessions, gathering feedback from real users to guide further improvements. Regular reviews were carried out to verify that the web app’s design aligned with the initial wireframes and mockups, ensuring consistency and coherence. 

*The readability of the both the Label cards and Description cards are optimally viewed in Tablet or Laptop screen sizes. 
The text on both the Label cards and the Description cards is quite small (but readable)when viewed on mobile devices. However, it was decided to keep with the images of the text which would all adapt in size uniformly in different viewports rather than adaptive text within the cards themselves as the text length of each card varies and therefore adaptive text would cause text of various sizes within the one game, which can contribute to 'visual clutter' for users and increase congnitive load, therefore making learning less effective.

### User Stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the end-user or stakeholder. They help to define the desired outcomes and provide a clear understanding of the user's needs and goals. In our project, user stories guided the development process, ensuring that each feature was designed with the user in mind.


| User Role  | User Story |
|------------|------------|
| As a player | I want a clear and easy-to-understand game structure so that I can focus on learning rather than figuring out how to play. |
| As a student | I want the game to be responsive so that I can study on different devices like my phone, tablet, or computer. |
| As a teacher | I want the design to be visually appealing and engaging so that it attracts and retains students' interest. |
| As a player | I want a shuffle function for the cards so that I am learning definitions and not just memorising card locations. |
| As a player | I want to see a start button so that I can begin the game when I am ready. |
| As a player | I want to see a grid of cards face down so that I can start matching pairs. |
| As a player | I want to click on a card to flip it over so that I can see the image or definition on the other side. |
| As a player | I want to see the cards flip back over if they do not match so that I can try again to find a matching pair. |
| As a player | I want to see the cards stay face up if they match so that I know I have found a correct pair. |
| As a player | I want to see a message when I have matched all pairs so that I know I have completed the game. |
| As a player | I want to see a timer counting up so that I can see how long it takes me to complete the game. |
| As a player | I want to see a counter for the number of attempts I have made so that I can track my progress and try to improve. |
| As a player | I want to see a reset button so that I can restart the game at any time. |
| As a player | I want to have different levels so that the game remains challenging and educational. |
| As a player | I want to have access to instructions, so that it’s easy to understand how to play the game. |

### Fonts

Choosing the right font is a critical aspect of UX design, as it greatly impacts readability and overall user experience. In the initial stages of our project, we selected the Google Font "Bangers" for its fun,  bold and eye-catching style. However, upon reflection, we realized that "Bangers" was limited to uppercase letters, which could hinder readability, especially for younger audiences. This limitation prompted us to explore alternative fonts that would enhance the readability for users of all ages.

<br>

<img src="readmedocs/bangers-font.png" alt="font use" width="40%" height="40%">
<br>


After experimenting with several fonts, including "Poppins," "Figtree," and "Jost." Each font was evaluated for its clarity, legibility, and visual appeal. After thorough testing and consideration, we ultimately settled on "Jost." This font provided the perfect balance of readability and style, ensuring that our game remained accessible and engaging for Key Stage 3 students. Our careful selection process highlights the importance of choosing the right font to create an inclusive and effective user experience.

<br>

<img src="readmedocs/jost-font.png" alt="font use" width="60%" height="60%">
<br>

### Images

When selecting the background image for our game, we carefully considered various science-themed visuals to ensure they aligned with the educational and aesthetic goals of our project. We evaluated numerous images, focusing on those that would effectively convey the theme of science lab safety. After thorough consideration, we decided on a laboratory image that would be both appealing and fun for a younger audience. It was important to choose an image that was engaging without being overly childish, so we opted for a vector-based cartoon style graphic. This choice was made to reflect the core concept of the game, which revolves around understanding and identifying laboratory safety hazards. The laboratory image provides an appropriate context for the game's content, helping to immerse students in a realistic and relevant environment. This thoughtful selection process underscores our commitment to creating an engaging and educational experience for Key Stage 3 students.

<br>

<br>

During the design process, we realized the importance of a unique and recognizable favicon to represent our game. After exploring various options, we found that there wasn't anything suitable that truly captured the essence of our project. As a result, we decided to create our own custom favicon. This allowed us to design a favicon that was perfectly aligned with our theme and aesthetic goals, ispecifically by adding a graphic of a pair of cards and the game initials. Our custom favicon not only enhances the visual identity of our game but also adds a professional touch to the overall user experience. The process of creating our own favicon ensured that we had a distinctive and memorable icon that stands out in users' browser tabs and bookmarks.

<br>

<img src="assets/images/FAVICONSS.png" alt="favicon image" width="20%" height="20%">

<br>

The selection of game cards was a critical part of our design process, ensuring that the content was both educational and engaging for students. We based our game cards on an image resource that depicted a grid of common science lab hazards. This comprehensive visual reference allowed us to choose relevant and recognizable hazards to include in the game. To enhance the learning experience, we decided to incorporate a "study first" modal, which would present the grid of hazards to students before they began playing. This modal provided a brief overview of the hazards, giving students an opportunity to memorise and familiarize themselves with the content and better understand what they would encounter on the game cards. Additionally, the card images would reflect the level of difficulty that the player selected, with the pairings varying based on the chosen difficulty level. By using this approach, we aimed to create an informative and interactive game that reinforces important lab safety concepts in an accessible and enjoyable way. Having different levels of difficulty meant that the game could appeal to older students who needed a more challenging study revision tool, catering to their advanced learning needs.

<br>

### Colours

When selecting the color scheme for our game, we began with our vibrant background image as the starting point. We wanted colors that would complement the fun and engaging theme while providing sufficient contrast for readability. After careful consideration, we chose dark cyan (rgba(0, 139, 139, 0.85)) and orange (#FF8400), alongside black and white. The dark cyan and orange provided a striking yet harmonious contrast that stood out against the colorful backdrop. Black and white were used to ensure clarity and legibility without straying too far from the chosen color palette. This thoughtful selection of colors ensured that the game was visually appealing, easy to read, and cohesive with the overall design theme, enhancing the user experience for our players.

## Features

To ensure our educational card matching game is engaging, intuitive, and beneficial for Key Stage 3 students, we have incorporated a range of essential features based upon the study of user needs. These features are designed to enhance the overall user experience while aligning with the educational objectives of the game. We prioritized creating a clear and easy-to-understand game structure, making sure the game is responsive and visually appealing across various devices.

Key functionalities include a shuffle function to randomize cards, a new game button for player control, and a grid of face-down cards to begin the matching process. We also included interactive elements such as a card flip function and feedback mechanisms like cards staying face-up when matched, a timer, a congratulatory alert when all pairs were matched, and a moves counter for tracking (and improving) progress. At the final review it was decided that we would add a "glow" to each card the user hovered over to aid in identifying which card was about to be selected, and once a pair had been matched both cards would be given a coloured border so that on completion of the game the player could visually identify all the matches. Additionally, the game offers different levels of difficulty, and accessible instructions to cater to diverse learning needs. These features collectively contribute to a fun, educational, and user-friendly game that effectively aids students in learning about science lab hazards.
<br>

### Instructions/Study First 

To enhance the educational value of our game, we introduced a "study first" modal that players can access before starting the card game. This modal presents an infographic, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the content and know what to expect. This preparation step helps reinforce the learning objectives by giving students a chance to review the hazards beforehand. Additionally, we incorporated detailed instructions to guide players on how to navigate and play the game effectively. To further support their learning, we provided a link to the BBC Bitesize website, a valuable resource for additional revision. These features collectively ensure that players are well-prepared and supported throughout their learning journey.
<br>

### Game board

When deciding the format of the game board, we prioritized ease of navigation and user familiarity. After considering various options, we opted for a 4x4 layout, which is intuitive and straightforward for players of all ages. This format ensures that the game remains accessible and engaging without overwhelming the user. Additionally, we adopted a tablet-first design approach to cater to the growing number of students using this go-to device school laboratories. This strategy ensured that the game board was optimized for touch interactions and provided a seamless experience across different devices. 
<br>

<img src="readmedocs/screenshot-hazards-game.png" alt="gameboard image" width="30%" height="30%">

### Game Cards
The selection and design of our game cards were central to creating an educational and engaging experience for players. They consisted of 3 game cards that correspond as follows:
Group a – symbols of hazards.
Group b – the name (label) of each hazard symbol.
Group c – the description of the risk posed by this hazard.

The game offers 3 levels of difficulty and the pairing combinations vary dependant upon each level: 
Easy – Match the ‘Symbol’ to its corresponding ‘Label’.
Medium – Match the ‘Symbol’ to the ‘Description of the risk’.
Hard – Match the ‘Label’ to the ‘Description of the risk’.

Subtle features added in the later stages of development includied: on hovering over a card (as well as the cursor change), a card a "glow" is visible to aid in identifying the current card that the player is selecting; and once a pair had been matched, both cards would be given a coloured border.

<br>


### Scores
To facilitate a more engaging and educational experience, we implemented several key features to help students monitor their progress and performance. We introduced counters to track the number of attempts and moves made by the players, as well as a timer to measure the time taken to complete the game. These metrics allow students to gauge their improvement over time and strategize more effectively, aiming to reduce errors with each playthrough and improve their speed while maintaining accuracy.


<img src="readmedocs/Scores-bar.png" alt="scores bar" width="60%" height="60%">
<br>


Additionally, we added an alert to congratulate the player when they correctly match all pairs. This alert not only celebrates their achievement but also displays their stats, providing a motivating and rewarding element to the game. This combination of features creates a motivating and interactive learning environment where students can set personal goals and continually strive to better their previous records.

<br>


### Responsive Design

This card matching game was initially designed with tablet devices in mind, as it was primarily intended for use by school children as an interactive study guide. The layout and interface elements have been optimized for tablet screen sizes to ensure an engaging and user-friendly experience on these devices. While the game is functional on laptop screens, we acknowledge that the responsiveness for larger displays could be improved. Given more development time, our next priority would be to enhance the game's adaptability to laptop and desktop screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across a wider range of devices.
<br>

<img src="readmedocs/Responsive-design.png" alt="responsive design" width="70%" height="70%">


### Future Features

Looking ahead, we have identified several potential features to further enhance the Hazards-Match game and broaden the scope of the Science-Shuffle product.

The Hazards-Match game could have minimal future features such as:
1 – a time-out feature – the game times-out when (for example) 5 minutes has elapsed – a message would pop up to let the player know that the game has timed-out and give the player the option to restart.

2 – a field to enter the players name so that
a - their name could be added to the ‘congratulations!’ message that appears when all matches in one game are complete
b – a leaderboard feature could be added.

The Science-Shuffle product could include many other games based on Scientific concepts, such as:

Periodic-table-Match (11-14yrs): match the (a) element name to the (b) element symbol with atomic number and atomic mass number group to the (c) properties of the group

Laboratory-equipment-Match (11-14yrs): match the (a) diagram of apparatus (b) name of the apparatus to the (c) description of its use.

## Agile Methodology

Throughout this project, our team implemented Agile methodology by using a Kanban board to efficiently manage tasks and ensure a smooth workflow. Utilizing GitHub Project Boards, we set up various user issues, assigning them to team members based on their expertise and availability. This allowed us to visually track the progress of each task, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize work effectively. 

By continuously updating the board and holding regular stand-ups, we maintained clear communication and quickly adapted to any changes, ensuring that we delivered high-quality results in a timely manner. Additionally, the use of GitHub Issues enabled us to document each task with detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and labels for easy categorization. This structured approach facilitated clear accountability and enhanced collaboration within the team, helping us achieve our project goals efficiently. 


Effective communication was pivotal to our project's success. Regularly attending huddles and actively using Slack messages ensured that all team members were informed and aligned on our progress and goals. This consistent communication allowed us to quickly address any issues, share updates, and collaborate efficiently. By maintaining open lines of communication, we were able to stay organized, make informed decisions, and ensure that everyone was on the same page, which ultimately led to a smooth and successful development process.

The Lighthouse validation results proved to be pleasing - it recommended that our site served images in next-gen formats therefore reducing unused CSS.

#### WAVE
The results from the WAVE validation were pleasing, and suggested that there were no major contrast errors.

#### W3C - HTML
W3C Validator identified errors that where then corrected and finally zero errors but 5 ‘Warnings’ remain - these all refer to not having a heading in the section – it was agreed that headings are not required in the sections.

### JS Hint
There were a few warnings in JSHint, primarily related to the use of let or arrow function syntax. These modern JavaScript features are sometimes unsupported or behave inconsistently in older browsers, such as certain versions of Mozilla Firefox. While these warnings highlight potential compatibility issues, they do not impact the core functionality of the game, as most modern browsers fully support these syntactical elements.
